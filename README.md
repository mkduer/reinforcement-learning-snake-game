#### Q Learning Algorithm
Implementing a Markov Decision Process based Q-Learning Algorithm with a slight twist
on the matrix implementation for the Q-Table, by using a sparse table.


#### Conclusion
The AI was able to learn and reached a peak of eating 14 mice.


### Resource
The idea for the Q Learning table implementation was inspired by https://italolelis.com/snake and the related repository in javascript: https://github.com/italohdc/LearnSnake
